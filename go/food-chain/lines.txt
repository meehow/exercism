How absurd to swallow a bird!
I don't know how she swallowed a cow!
I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.
I know an old lady who swallowed a bird.
I know an old lady who swallowed a cat.
I know an old lady who swallowed a cow.
I know an old lady who swallowed a dog.
I know an old lady who swallowed a fly.
I know an old lady who swallowed a goat.
I know an old lady who swallowed a horse.
I know an old lady who swallowed a spider.
Imagine that, to swallow a cat!
It wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.
Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird.
She swallowed the cow to catch the goat.
She swallowed the dog to catch the cat.
She swallowed the goat to catch the dog.
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly.
She's dead, of course!
What a hog, to swallow a dog!
